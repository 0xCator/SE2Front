# An Autonomous Fainting Attacks Savior System (frontend)
This is repository contains the frontend part of our project for a Software Engineering 2 course, *an autonomous fainting attacks savior system*.

The project contains 3 views:
- Admin view
- Ambulance manager view
- Patient/Relative view

The project also contains some *Google Maps* features and some real-time refreshing, through ``timer`` from RxJS.

The complete project requires the installation of the [backend](https://github.com/0xCator/SE2Back) and [bracelet simulation](https://github.com/0xCator/Bracelet-SE2) to work properly.

## Quick start
```
$ npm i
$ ng serve
```

## Note
You must provide your Google Maps API Key, placing it in the ``index.html`` file (at line 12).
